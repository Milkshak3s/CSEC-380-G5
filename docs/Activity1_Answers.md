# Activity 1

1. What is the URL of your GitHub project?
- https://github.com/Milkshak3s/CSEC-380-G5

2. How did you break up your projects and what are the security ramifications?
- Projects for the first 2 activities-worth of tasks were broken up by a major feature such as implementing testing or writing design documentation. For future work, projects will be broken up by major feature, such as an authentication system, or being able to post on the site. Security-wise, this logically groups a number or related changes together for testing, which should make it clearer what change or set of changes is causing a vulnerability.

3. How did you choose to break down your Epic into various issues (tasks)?
- Epics were broken down into tasks by seperating out individual contributions that could be accomplished in a relatively short amount of time, such as defining a process, or adding a Dockerfile to the
 repo.

4. How long did you assign each sprint to be?
- Each sprint will be 1 week long.

5. Did you deviate from the Agile methodology at all? If yes, what is your reasoning for this?
- 

6. How do you ensure that after each issue/milestone that security has been verified? How would you identify such issues in an ideal environment?
-
