# Activity 1

1. What is the URL of your GitHub project?
- https://github.com/Milkshak3s/CSEC-380-G5

2. How did you break up your projects and what are the security ramifications?
- 

3. How did you choose to break down your Epic into various issues (tasks)?
- Epics were broken down into tasks by seperating out individual contributions that could be accomplished in a relatively short amount of time, such as defining a process, or adding a Dockerfile to the
 repo.

4. How long did you assign each sprint to be?
- 

5. Did you deviate from the Agile methodology at all? If yes, what is your reasoning for this?
- Yes, in a couple ways. First, we are collapsing the review, retrospective, and next sprint planning into a single meeting. This is more in align with our team member's schedules, as well as the light amount of work (in comparison to a major project at a company). Second, we will be doing "standup" updates over slack as things are started / finished / blocked, rather than daily, which is easier for students with heavy schedules, and more accurate to the ammount of work. Finally we will not be doing backlog grooming, which is unecessary in a class project with specifically assigned features.

6. How do you ensure that after each issue/milestone that security has been verified? How would you identify such issues in an ideal environment?
-
