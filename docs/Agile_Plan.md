# G5 Agile Process

Sprint length: 1 week

### Doing
Sprint planning: Weekly, 7:00pm on Thursdays

### Doing, but a little different
Standups:        As new work as started or finished (as opposed to daily at a specific time)
Retrospective:   Part of sprint planning meeting
Sprint review:   Part of sprint planning meeting, not waiting until here to mark things done, not presenting to stakeholders

### Not doing
Backlog refinement: Not doing (not really valid for a class assignment)
